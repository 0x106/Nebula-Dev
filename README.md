## Versioning

### Rules

* The commit messages should be formatted [as explained here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning releases.
* Never commit directly on `master`


The workflow is as such:

* Create a feature branch with a sensible name
* Commit work to the feature branch
* When ready, open a merge request onto `master`
* Ask someone to review your code, and once you are given a thumbs up, you can merge
* **Make sure to squash your commits on the feature branch into one before to merge on master!**
